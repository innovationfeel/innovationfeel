    product_design_ux: "<p>Of course, the most important part of any application is the User Experience (UX).\n

    we_build: "We build Web applications and Mobile APIs based on the <b>Ruby on Rails</b>\n
    framework using modern technologies and best practices."

    why_ruby_on_rails: "<li><b>Efficient in terms of time:</b> The process of development is faster\n
    than with other frameworks and languages, partly because of the object-oriented nature of Ruby\n
    and the large collection of open source code available within the Rails community. That's why time\n
    to final product would be cut down amazingly.</li>\n
    <li><b>Rapid application development:</b> Rails is good for rapid application development (RAD),\n
    as the framework makes it easy to accommodate changes.</li>\n
    <li><b>Efficient in terms of cost:</b> Ruby on Rails is free and does not cost anything to download or use.\n
    It also runs on a free operating system and works with mostly free databases and web servers.</li>\n
    <li><b>Testing:</b> Rails has developed a strong focus on testing and has good testing frameworks.</li>\n
    <li><b>Allows a high level of interaction:</b> Ruby on Rails is suitable for web applications that require\n
    a lot of content input, storage and management because you would be easily navigating the site, managing\n
    and uploading content. If you want to build a CRM, CMS or e-commerce system, Ruby on Rails is a perfect fit.</li>"
